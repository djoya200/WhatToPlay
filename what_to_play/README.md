<!-- A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc -->

To create this app I used javascript, react, css, and html. I deployed my site using Heroku.

# Approach Taken

### The Problem: 
> When friends come over or children get toegther, they often have a hard time finding a game that they can all play and within a certian timeframe. 

### The Solution: 
>See all games that meet your needs easily with: "What to play!"

### Future Features: 
> This app currently allows for you to search for games by the number of people who are going to be playing. In the future I plan to refactor this app and allow it to also search by playing time and category.
